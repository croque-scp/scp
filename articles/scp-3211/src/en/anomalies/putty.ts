  physicalDescription: `
    SCP-3211 is a small container of Silly Putty-brand putty. It displays all
    the same physical properties of Silly Putty.

    All who observe SCP-3211 will be in a state of misery, to some degree.
    Viewers have consistently complained about their mood prior to seeing
    SCP-3211; in some cases they will have remarked upon some negative event
    that occurred that morning or the night before even before finding out
    about SCP-3211's existence. In many cases, however, observers will be
    unable to find a reason for their mood, and in this event will cite
    SCP-3211 as the reason. It is as yet unconfirmed whether this is
    coincidence or a result of SCP-3211 observation.

  conclusion: `
    At this point Dr. Greaves left the cell and admitted himself to the Site's
    medical ward. He was kept under observation until the mnestic wore off, but
    did not retain any memory of his experiment.
