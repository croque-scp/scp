  objectClass: "Euclid",
  physicalDescription: `
    SCP-3211 is a female human of possibly Czech descent. SCP-3211 does not
    require nourishment or exercise, and presumably does not require social
    contact. The entity stands in the same spot in the centre of its
    containment chamber at all times, presumably through its own volition.
    SCP-3211 does not blink, breathe, does not have a beating heart, does not
    change facial expression, and does not display any signs of life. Other
    than these discrepancies, the entity is in good health. SCP-3211 responds
    to most lines of questioning with the word "Nerozumím", which is assumed to
    be its name, but otherwise does not speak.

  writtenObservation: `
    There's a woman just kind of stood in the middle of the room. She looks
    weird, and she's got this really creepy smile. Like, not overly creepy,
    just like it's fake. And she doesn't move.
