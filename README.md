# SCP Works

This is a monorepo for my works on the [SCP Wiki](https://scpwiki.com).

Some of the sub-repositories are backups, and the published work on the Wiki is
considered to be the canonical source of truth for that article.

Some of the sub-repositories are the source code and build process for their
article. They are considered the source of truth, and the published work is
considered to be generated code that can be overwritten (including any changes
made to it) at any time. The output for these articles contains a note
indicating that any changes made to the published work and not reflected in
this repository will be ignored.

## Development

### Contributing

For sub-repositories that are backups, contributions should be made to the
corresponding page on the SCP Wiki. The backup being a little bit out of date
is considered normal.

For sub-repositories that contain the source code, contributions should be made
in a Pull Request to this repository. I will add instructions for doing this
later.

Currently, there are no articles in this repository that are not considered
backups, and I haven't yet worked out how building is going to work.

### Translating

I'm not too sure how this is going to work yet, either. This is just a note to
say that I haven't forgotten about it.
